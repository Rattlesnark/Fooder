------------------------------------------------

Overall "Features":
1. Share FB
2. Favourite (DB?)

4. Upload (DB?)
5. Database
6. Rating (DB?) -> How to record?
7. Comments (DB?)
[X] 8. Video -> Seems simple enough, Youtube API.
[X] + Toast? -> Used before, re-apply as "new UI element exploration"
9. Push notifications?

Location?
[X] Search? -> AppCode example available, http://www.appcoda.com/search-bar-tutorial-ios7/

Inquiries:
* Need 12? (3 per member?)
* Any of the above overlapping?
* Fine if project accounts for single user only in database? (one rating, one favourite table, etc.)

Current Pages:
1. Login
2. Register
3. Recipes list
	-> 4. View full recipe
5. Add new recipe
6. My Favourites

** Note: Do more exploration, donâ€™t spend TOO much time on Database.

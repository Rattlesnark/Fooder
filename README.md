Features v4.txt (Last edited 1.32PM, 18-7)
------------------------------------------------

Overall "Features":
[/] 5. FB Share -> Button implemented. Not sure if actually functional (requires login).
? Favourite (DB?)
? Login (DB?) -> Need to encrypt password? FB Login implemented, although functionality not tested.
? Upload (DB?)
+ Database
? Rating (DB?) -> How to record?
? Comments (DB?)
[/] 1. Video -> Seems simple enough, Youtube API. Edit code to make it load appropriate video based on recipe.
[/] 2. Toast -> Used before, re-apply as "new UI element exploration"
+ Push notifications
+ Location?
[/] 3. Search -> AppCode example available, http://www.appcoda.com/search-bar-tutorial-ios7/. Implemented, but not coded.
? Timer?
+ Animation -> Pop framework installed. More marks for proper complex animations (in terms of coding/implementation?).
[X] 6. FB Login -> Button implemented. Not sure if actually functional (requires login).
+ Cloud -> Save stuff online.
+ Save/export feature -> Export data onto an external service/API. Evernote?
[/] 8. Google Calendar -> Mark a date as reminder to "prepare a recipe on this particular day". 

<NEW> "Minor" features (fulfill quota, not big weightage for marks):
~ Custom text field (with framework)
[X] 4. UI scroll view
[X] 7. UI tab view

Inquiries:
X Need 12 of "new exploration"? (3 per member?)
* Any of the above overlapping?
X Fine if project accounts for single user only in database? (one rating, one favourite table, etc.)
X CocoaPods, custom text field... count as "new exploration"?

More stuff?:
> Account settings

Exploring/Explored:
CoreData -> Just use web database?

Unusable:
SensibleTableView -> Cannot be used with CoreData. Demo video capabilities not applicable. Product purchase required.

Notes:
> Do more exploration, donâ€™t spend TOO much time on Database.
- Cocoapods - Each framework counts as 1 "new exploration". Marking weightage depends on how substantial the implementation is.

// Document on the FB auth error!

Features v6.txt (Last edited 10.14PM, 24/7)
Regarding "complete" version of project.
------------------------------------------------

Overall "Features":
[/] 1. FB Share -> Button implemented. Not sure if actually functional (requires login).
[X] 2. Login -> DB + Auth0 framework functionality. FB login untested.
[X] 3. Upload -> Can upload to database, but no hosting feature for images/videos. Photo browser in place as mockup.
[X] 4. Database -> SQLite
[X] 5. Video -> Seems simple enough, Youtube API. Edit code to make it load appropriate video based on recipe.
[X] 6. Toast -> Used before, re-apply as "new UI element exploration"
[X] 7. Search -> Searching using built-in search bar with controller. Searching limited to 'starts with x'.
[X] 8. Animation -> Pop framework installed. More marks for proper complex animations (in terms of coding/implementation?).
[X] ~ FB Login -> Button implemented. Not sure if actually functional (requires login).
[X] 9. Google Calendar -> Mark a date as reminder to "prepare a recipe on this particular day". Implementation unoptimal, only works in allowing 

logging in to Google account and viewing pseudo-calendar page.

<NEW> "Minor" features (fulfill quota, not big weightage for marks):
~ Custom text field (with framework)
[X] 10. UI scroll view
[X] 11. UI tab view
[X] 12. JVFloating Text Field/View framework.
[X] 13. Phone image browser integration.
[X] ~ Unwind segues

+ Other frameworks imported via Cocoapods?

Scrapped features:
Unusable -
X Push notifications -> Not feasible. Requires server connection.
X SensibleTableView -> Cannot be used with CoreData. Demo video capabilities not applicable. Product purchase required.

Abandoned - 
- Favourite
- Comments
- Ratings
~ Location
~ "Timer"
- Cloud saving (export/import)

Inquiries:
X Need 12 of "new exploration"? (3 per member?)
* Any of the above overlapping?
X Fine if project accounts for single user only in database? (one rating, one favourite table, etc.)
X CocoaPods, custom text field... count as "new exploration"?

Exploring/Explored:
CoreData -> Just use web database?
Firebase -> Taro's work. Functionality unknown. Will be presented.
Auth0 -> Taro's work. Somewhat functional. Will be presented.
Cloudinator -> Marcus's work. Functionality unknown. Will be presented.

Notes:
- FB auth error due to FB app not install on device.
